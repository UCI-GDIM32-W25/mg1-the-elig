## Devlog
1. Eli Gutierrez (they/them)


2. The in-class activity helped solidify in my mind what `Player` member variables (attributes) and functions/methods (actions) both classes should have. For example, I knew the `Player` class should have a `PlantSeed()` function that instantiates copies of a `Plant` prefab at the `_playerTransform.position`, and would have to have member variables keeping track of how many seeds the player had left. Additionally, the in-class activity helped me understand how the `Player` class and the `PlayerCountUI` classes interacted with each other. Specifically, understanding that `PlayerCountUI` ONLY "action" was to display (through `TMP_Text` game objects/components) the calculations that were already done in the `Player` class.
